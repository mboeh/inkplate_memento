# Inkplate Memento

Arduino code to use the [Inkplate](https://inkplate.io) to display digital "greeting cards" composed of text and 1-bit graphics. Cards can be written as text files and uploaded via the serial interface with `memento-client.rb` (this requires the `uart` gem).

## Resources

* The graphics in `pics/` are from Hypercard, from [this helpful compilation](https://mariteaux.somnolescent.net/junk/hypercard/).
* The Century Schoolbook font was generated [here](https://oleddisplay.squix.ch/).
* The silly text in the included messages was written by me, except for `horse.txt', which was written by [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://mbmbam.fandom.com/wiki/Fugue_for_Brotherhorns).
